# OpenAI Computer Using Agent (CUA) Sample App

## Project Overview
Sample application demonstrating how to build AI agents that can interact with computer interfaces by viewing screenshots and performing actions (click, type, scroll).

## Key Files
- `README.md` - Comprehensive project documentation
- `cli.py` - Main entry point for running the app with different environments
- `agent/agent.py` - Agent implementation that handles model interaction
- `computers/computer.py` - Computer interface defining available actions
- `simple_cua_loop.py` - Basic implementation of CUA loop

## Key Commands
```
# Setup
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run with local browser
python cli.py --computer local-playwright

# Run with other environments
python cli.py --show --computer docker
python cli.py --show --computer browserbase
```

## Project Structure
- `agent/` - Agent implementation
- `computers/` - Implementations for different computer environments
- `examples/` - Sample use cases

See README.md for detailed instructions on setup, implementation details, and safety considerations.
